# R for the impatient

This document is intended to provide a quick (yet complete!) overview of the `R` language, so you can get started with it as soon as possible. No chit-chatting, just the basics, code and comments!  Oh well, we will give some details  concerning the first steps; and sometimes we will link to useful resources, just in case you really want to go deeper into some topic ...

## How to use it
There are two main files:

* The `impatient_r.html` file. If you are an absolute beginner, just use this file!
* The `impatient_r.Rmd` file. If you don't know what it is, don't worry. Rmd stands for R Markdown, a very cool framework that permits to combine R code with Markdown. Indeed, the `impatient_r.html` file has been generated with the `impatient_r.Rmd` file! In summary:
  * If you know how to handle .Rmd files, use `impatient_r.Rmd` for learning.
  * If you don't, just use the .html file and then learn about R Markdown. See, for example, [this tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).
